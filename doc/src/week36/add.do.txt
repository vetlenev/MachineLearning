===== Summary from last Week and Examples =====

!split
===== Linear Regression and  the SVD =====

We used the SVD to analyse the matrix to invert in ordinary lineat regression
!bt
\[
\bm{X}^T\bm{X}=\bm{V}\bm{\Sigma}^T\bm{U}^T\bm{U}\bm{\Sigma}\bm{V}^T=\bm{V}\bm{\Sigma}^T\bm{\Sigma}\bm{V}^T. 
\]
!et
Since the matrices here have dimension $p\times p$, with $p$ corresponding to the singular values, we defined last week the matrix
!bt
\[
\bm{\Sigma}^T\bm{\Sigma} = \begin{bmatrix} \tilde{\bm{\Sigma}} & \bm{0}\\ \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} \tilde{\bm{\Sigma}} \\ \bm{0}\end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
where the tilde-matrix $\tilde{\bm{\Sigma}}$ is a matrix of dimension $p\times p$ containing only the singular values $\sigma_i$, that is

!bt
\[
\tilde{\bm{\Sigma}}=\begin{bmatrix} \sigma_0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0 \\
                                    0 & \sigma_1 & 0 & \dots & 0 & 0 \\
				    0 & 0 & \sigma_2 & \dots & 0 & 0 \\
				    0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & \sigma_{p-2} & 0 \\
				    0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 & \sigma_{p-1} \\
\end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
meaning we can write
!bt
\[
\bm{X}^T\bm{X}=\bm{V}\tilde{\bm{\Sigma}}^2\bm{V}^T. 
\]
!et
Multiplying from the right with $\bm{V}$ (using the orthogonality of $\bm{V}$) we get
!bt
\[
\left(\bm{X}^T\bm{X}\right)\bm{V}=\bm{V}\tilde{\bm{\Sigma}}^2. 
\]
!et

!split
===== What does it mean? =====

This means the vectors $\bm{v}_i$ of the orthogonal matrix $\bm{V}$
are the eigenvectors of the matrix $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$ with eigenvalues
given by the singular values squared, that is

!bt
\[
\left(\bm{X}^T\bm{X}\right)\bm{v}_i=\bm{v}_i\sigma_i^2. 
\]
!et

In other words, each non-zero singular value of $\bm{X}$ is a positive
square root of an eigenvalue of $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$.  It means also that
the columns of $\bm{V}$ are the eigenvectors of
$\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$. Since we have ordered the singular values of
$\bm{X}$ in a descending order, it means that the column vectors
$\bm{v}_i$ are hierarchically ordered by how much correlation they
encode from the columns of $\bm{X}$. 


Note that these are also the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the
Hessian matrix.

If we now recall the definition of the covariance matrix (not using
Bessel's correction) we have


!bt
\[
\bm{C}[\bm{X}]=\frac{1}{n}\bm{X}^T\bm{X},
\]
!et

meaning that every squared non-singular value of $\bm{X}$ divided by $n$ (
the number of samples) are the eigenvalues of the covariance
matrix. Every singular value of $\bm{X}$ is thus a positive square
root of an eigenvalue of $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$. If the matrix $\bm{X}$ is
self-adjoint, the singular values of $\bm{X}$ are equal to the
absolute value of the eigenvalues of $\bm{X}$.

!split
===== And finally  $\bm{X}\bm{X}^T$ =====

For $\bm{X}\bm{X}^T$ we found

!bt
\[
\bm{X}\bm{X}^T=\bm{U}\bm{\Sigma}\bm{V}^T\bm{V}\bm{\Sigma}^T\bm{U}^T=\bm{U}\bm{\Sigma}^T\bm{\Sigma}\bm{U}^T. 
\]
!et
Since the matrices here have dimension $n\times n$, we have
!bt
\[
\bm{\Sigma}\bm{\Sigma}^T = \begin{bmatrix} \tilde{\bm{\Sigma}} \\ \bm{0}\\ \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix} \tilde{\bm{\Sigma}}  \bm{0}\\ \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix} \tilde{\bm{\Sigma}} & \bm{0} \\ \bm{0} & \bm{0}\\ \end{bmatrix}, 
\]
!et
leading to
!bt
\[
\bm{X}\bm{X}^T=\bm{U}\begin{bmatrix} \tilde{\bm{\Sigma}} & \bm{0} \\ \bm{0} & \bm{0}\\ \end{bmatrix}\bm{U}^T. 
\]
!et

Multiplying with $\bm{U}$ from the right gives us the eigenvalue problem
!bt
\[
(\bm{X}\bm{X}^T)\bm{U}=\bm{U}\begin{bmatrix} \tilde{\bm{\Sigma}} & \bm{0} \\ \bm{0} & \bm{0}\\ \end{bmatrix}. 
\]
!et

It means that the eigenvalues of $\bm{X}\bm{X}^T$ are again given by
the non-zero singular values plus now a series of zeros.  The column
vectors of $\bm{U}$ are the eigenvectors of $\bm{X}\bm{X}^T$ and
measure how much correlations are contained in the rows of $\bm{X}$.

Since we will mainly be interested in the correlations among the features
of our data (the columns of $\bm{X}$, the quantity of interest for us are the non-zero singular
values and the column vectors of $\bm{V}$.



!split
=====  Code for SVD and Inversion of Matrices =====

How do we use the SVD to invert a matrix $\bm{X}^\bm{X}$ which is singular or near singular?
The simple answer is to use the linear algebra function for pseudoinvers, that is
!bc pycod
Ainv = np.linlag.pinv(A)
!ec

Let us first look at a matrix which does not causes problems and write our own function where we just use the SVD.

!bc pycod
import numpy as np
# SVD inversion
def SVDinv(A):
    ''' Takes as input a numpy matrix A and returns inv(A) based on singular value decomposition (SVD).
    SVD is numerically more stable than the inversion algorithms provided by
    numpy and scipy.linalg at the cost of being slower.
    '''
    U, s, VT = np.linalg.svd(A)
    print('test U')
    print( (np.transpose(U) @ U - U @np.transpose(U)))
    print('test VT')
    print( (np.transpose(VT) @ VT - VT @np.transpose(VT)))


    D = np.zeros((len(U),len(VT)))
    D = np.diag(s)
    UT = np.transpose(U); V = np.transpose(VT); invD = np.linalg.inv(D)
    return np.matmul(V,np.matmul(invD,UT))


#X = np.array([ [1.0, -1.0, 2.0], [1.0, 0.0, 1.0], [1.0, 2.0, -1.0], [1.0, 1.0, 0.0] ])
# Non-singular square matrix
X = np.array( [ [1,2,3],[2,4,5],[3,5,6]])
print(X)
A = np.transpose(X) @ X
# Brute force inversion
B = np.linalg.inv(A)  # here we could use np.linalg.pinv(A)
C = SVDinv(A)
print(np.abs(B-C))

!ec

!split
===== Inverse of Rectangular Matrix =====

Although our matrix to invert $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$ is a square matrix, our matrix may be singular. 

The pseudoinverse is the generalization of the matrix inverse for square matrices to
rectangular matrices where the number of rows and columns are not equal.

It is also called the the Moore-Penrose Inverse after two independent discoverers of the method or the Generalized Inverse.
It is used for the calculation of the inverse for singular or near singular matrices and for rectangular matrices.

Using the SVD we can obtain the pseudoinverse of a matrix $\bm{A}$ (labeled here as $\bm{A}_{\mathrm{PI}}$
!bt
\[
\bm{A}_{\mathrm{PI}}= \bm{V}\bm{D}_{\mathrm{PI}}\bm{U}^T,
\]
!et
where $\bm{D}_{\mathrm{PI}}$ can be calculated by creating a diagonal matrix from $\bm{Sigma}$ where we only keep the singular values (the non-zero values). The following code computes the pseudoinvers of the matrix based on the SVD.


!bc pycod
import numpy as np
# SVD inversion
def SVDinv(A):
    U, s, VT = np.linalg.svd(A)
    # reciprocals of singular values of s
    d = 1.0 / s
    # create m x n D matrix
    D = np.zeros(A.shape)
    # populate D with n x n diagonal matrix
    D[:A.shape[1], :A.shape[1]] = np.diag(d)
    UT = np.transpose(U)
    V = np.transpose(VT)
    return np.matmul(V,np.matmul(D.T,UT))


A = np.array([ [0.3, 0.4], [0.5, 0.6], [0.7, 0.8],[0.9, 1.0]])
print(A)
# Brute force inversion of super-collinear matrix
B = np.linalg.pinv(A)
print(B)
# Compare our own algorithm with pinv
C = SVDinv(A)
print(np.abs(C-B))

!ec
As you can see from this example, our own decomposition based on the SVD agrees the pseudoinverse algorithm provided by _Numpy_.



!split
===== Ridge and LASSO Regression =====

Let us remind ourselves about the expression for the standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) which we used to define our cost function and the equations for the ordinary least squares (OLS) method, that is 
our optimization problem is
!bt
\[
{\displaystyle \min_{\bm{\beta}\in {\mathbb{R}}^{p}}}\frac{1}{n}\left\{\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\right)^T\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\right)\right\}.
\]
!et
or we can state it as
!bt
\[
{\displaystyle \min_{\bm{\beta}\in
{\mathbb{R}}^{p}}}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\left(y_i-\tilde{y}_i\right)^2=\frac{1}{n}\vert\vert \bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\vert\vert_2^2,
\]
!et
where we have used the definition of  a norm-2 vector, that is
!bt
\[
\vert\vert \bm{x}\vert\vert_2 = \sqrt{\sum_i x_i^2}. 
\]
!et

!split
===== From OLS to Ridge and Lasso =====

By minimizing the above equation with respect to the parameters
$\bm{\beta}$ we could then obtain an analytical expression for the
parameters $\bm{\beta}$.  We can add a regularization parameter $\lambda$ by
defining a new cost function to be optimized, that is

!bt
\[
{\displaystyle \min_{\bm{\beta}\in
{\mathbb{R}}^{p}}}\frac{1}{n}\vert\vert \bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\vert\vert_2^2+\lambda\vert\vert \bm{\beta}\vert\vert_2^2
\]
!et

which leads to the Ridge regression minimization problem where we
require that $\vert\vert \bm{\beta}\vert\vert_2^2\le t$, where $t$ is
a finite number larger than zero. By defining

!bt
\[
C(\bm{X},\bm{\beta})=\frac{1}{n}\vert\vert \bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\vert\vert_2^2+\lambda\vert\vert \bm{\beta}\vert\vert_1,
\]
!et

we have a new optimization equation
!bt
\[
{\displaystyle \min_{\bm{\beta}\in
{\mathbb{R}}^{p}}}\frac{1}{n}\vert\vert \bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\vert\vert_2^2+\lambda\vert\vert \bm{\beta}\vert\vert_1
\]
!et
which leads to Lasso regression. Lasso stands for least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. 

Here we have defined the norm-1 as 
!bt
\[
\vert\vert \bm{x}\vert\vert_1 = \sum_i \vert x_i\vert. 
\]
!et


!split
===== Deriving the  Ridge Regression Equations =====

Using the matrix-vector expression for Ridge regression and dropping the parameter $1/n$ in front of the standard means squared error equation, we have

!bt
\[
C(\bm{X},\bm{\beta})=\left\{(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta})^T(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta})\right\}+\lambda\bm{\beta}^T\bm{\beta},
\]
!et
and 
taking the derivatives with respect to $\bm{\beta}$ we obtain then
a slightly modified matrix inversion problem which for finite values
of $\lambda$ does not suffer from singularity problems. We obtain
the optimal parameters
!bt
\[
\hat{\bm{\beta}}_{\mathrm{Ridge}} = \left(\bm{X}^T\bm{X}+\lambda\bm{I}\right)^{-1}\bm{X}^T\bm{y},
\]
!et

with $\bm{I}$ being a $p\times p$ identity matrix with the constraint that

!bt
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{p-1} \beta_i^2 \leq t,
\]
!et

with $t$ a finite positive number. 

When we compare this with the ordinary least squares result we have
!bt
\[
\hat{\bm{\beta}}_{\mathrm{OLS}} = \left(\bm{X}^T\bm{X}\right)^{-1}\bm{X}^T\bm{y},
\]
!et
which can lead to singular matrices. However, with the SVD, we can always compute the inverse of the matrix $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$.


We see that Ridge regression is nothing but the standard OLS with a
modified diagonal term added to $\bm{X}^T\bm{X}$. The consequences, in
particular for our discussion of the bias-variance tradeoff are rather
interesting. We will see that for specific values of $\lambda$, we may
even reduce the variance of the optimal parameters $\bm{\beta}$. These topics and other related ones, will be discussed after the more linear algebra oriented analysis here.

!split
===== SVD analysis =====

Using our insights about the SVD of the design matrix $\bm{X}$ 
We have already analyzed the OLS solutions in terms of the eigenvectors (the columns) of the right singular value matrix $\bm{U}$ as
!bt
\[
\tilde{\bm{y}}_{\mathrm{OLS}}=\bm{X}\bm{\beta}  =\bm{U}\bm{U}^T\bm{y}.
\]
!et


For Ridge regression this becomes

!bt
\[
\tilde{\bm{y}}_{\mathrm{Ridge}}=\bm{X}\bm{\beta}_{\mathrm{Ridge}} = \bm{U\Sigma V^T}\left(\bm{V}\bm{\Sigma}^2\bm{V}^T+\lambda\bm{I} \right)^{-1}(\bm{U\Sigma V^T})^T\bm{y}=\sum_{j=0}^{p-1}\bm{u}_j\bm{u}_j^T\frac{\sigma_j^2}{\sigma_j^2+\lambda}\bm{y},
\]
!et

with the vectors $\bm{u}_j$ being the columns of $\bm{U}$ from the SVD of the matrix $\bm{X}$. 

!split
===== Interpreting the Ridge results =====

Since $\lambda \geq 0$, it means that compared to OLS, we have 

!bt
\[
\frac{\sigma_j^2}{\sigma_j^2+\lambda} \leq 1. 
\]
!et

Ridge regression finds the coordinates of $\bm{y}$ with respect to the
orthonormal basis $\bm{U}$, it then shrinks the coordinates by
$\frac{\sigma_j^2}{\sigma_j^2+\lambda}$. Recall that the SVD has
eigenvalues ordered in a descending way, that is $\sigma_i \geq
\sigma_{i+1}$.

For small eigenvalues $\sigma_i$ it means that their contributions become less important, a fact which can be used to reduce the number of degrees of freedom. More about this when we have covered the material on a statistical interpretation of various linear regression methods.


!split
===== More interpretations =====

For the sake of simplicity, let us assume that the design matrix is orthonormal, that is 

!bt
\[
\bm{X}^T\bm{X}=(\bm{X}^T\bm{X})^{-1} =\bm{I}. 
\]
!et

In this case the standard OLS results in 
!bt
\[
\bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{OLS}} = \bm{X}^T\bm{y}=\sum_{i=0}^{p-1}\bm{u}_j\bm{u}_j^T\bm{y},
\]
!et

and

!bt
\[
\bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{Ridge}} = \left(\bm{I}+\lambda\bm{I}\right)^{-1}\bm{X}^T\bm{y}=\left(1+\lambda\right)^{-1}\bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{OLS}},
\]
!et

that is the Ridge estimator scales the OLS estimator by the inverse of a factor $1+\lambda$, and
the Ridge estimator converges to zero when the hyperparameter goes to
infinity.

We will come back to more interpreations after we have gone through some of the statistical analysis part. 

For more discussions of Ridge and Lasso regression, "Wessel van Wieringen's":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.09169" article is highly recommended.
Similarly, "Mehta et al's article":"https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08823" is also recommended.

!split
===== Deriving the  Lasso Regression Equations =====

Using the matrix-vector expression for Lasso regression and dropping the parameter $1/n$ in front of the standard mean squared error equation, we have the following _cost_ function

!bt
\[
C(\bm{X},\bm{\beta})=\left\{(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta})^T(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta})\right\}+\lambda\vert\vert\bm{\beta}\vert\vert_1,
\]
!et

Taking the derivative with respect to $\bm{\beta}$ and recalling that the derivative of the absolute value is (we drop the boldfaced vector symbol for simplicty)
!bt
\[
\frac{d \vert \beta\vert}{d \bm{\beta}}=\mathrm{sgn}(\bm{\beta})=\left\{\begin{array}{cc} 1 & \beta > 0 \\ 0 & \beta =0\\-1 & \beta < 0, \end{array}\right.
\]
!et
we have that the derivative of the cost function is

!bt
\[
\frac{\partial C(\bm{X},\bm{\beta})}{\partial \bm{\beta}}=-2\bm{X}^T(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta})+\lambda sgn(\bm{\beta})=0,
\]
!et
and reordering we have
!bt
\[
\bm{X}^T\bm{X}\bm{\beta}+\lambda sgn(\bm{\beta})=2\bm{X}^T\bm{y}.
\]
!et
This equation does not lead to a nice analytical equation as in Ridge regression or ordinary least squares. This equation can however be solved by using standard convex optimization algorithms using for example the Python package "CVXOPT":"https://cvxopt.org/". We will discuss this later. 




!split
===== Simple example to illustrate Ordinary Least Squares, Ridge and Lasso Regression =====

Let us assume that our design matrix is given by unit (identity) matrix, that is a square diagonal matrix with ones only along the
diagonal. In this case we have an equal number of rows and columns $n=p$.

Our model approximation is just $\tilde{\bm{y}}=\bm{\beta}$ and the mean squared error and thereby the cost function for ordinary least sqquares (OLS) is then (we drop the term $1/n$) 
!bt
\[
C(\bm{\beta})=\sum_{i=0}^{p-1}(y_i-\beta_i)^2,
\]
!et
and minimizing we have that
!bt
\[
\hat{\beta}_i^{\mathrm{OLS}} = y_i.
\]
!et

!split
===== Ridge Regression =====

For Ridge regression our cost function is
!bt
\[
C(\bm{\beta})=\sum_{i=0}^{p-1}(y_i-\beta_i)^2+\lambda\sum_{i=0}^{p-1}\beta_i^2,
\]
!et
and minimizing we have that
!bt
\[
\hat{\beta}_i^{\mathrm{Ridge}} = \frac{y_i}{1+\lambda}.
\]
!et


!split
===== Lasso Regression =====

For Lasso regression our cost function is
!bt
\[
C(\bm{\beta})=\sum_{i=0}^{p-1}(y_i-\beta_i)^2+\lambda\sum_{i=0}^{p-1}\vert\beta_i\vert=\sum_{i=0}^{p-1}(y_i-\beta_i)^2+\lambda\sum_{i=0}^{p-1}\sqrt{\beta_i^2},
\]
!et
and minimizing we have that
!bt
\[
-2\sum_{i=0}^{p-1}(y_i-\beta_i)+\lambda \sum_{i=0}^{p-1}\frac{(\beta_i)}{\vert\beta_i\vert}=0,
\]
!et
which leads to 
!bt
\[
\hat{\bm{\beta}}_i^{\mathrm{Lasso}} = \left\{\begin{array}{ccc}y_i-\frac{\lambda}{2} &\mathrm{if} & y_i> \frac{\lambda}{2}\\
                                                          y_i+\frac{\lambda}{2} &\mathrm{if} & y_i< -\frac{\lambda}{2}\\
							  0 &\mathrm{if} & \vert y_i\vert\le  \frac{\lambda}{2}\end{array}\right.\\.
\]
!et

Plotting these results (figure in handwritten notes for week 36) shows clearly that Lasso regression suppresses (sets to zero) values of $\beta_i$ for specific values of $\lambda$. Ridge regression reduces on the other hand the values of $\beta_i$ as function of $\lambda$.

We will now couple the discussions of ordinary least squares, Ridge and Lasso regression with a statistical interpretation, that is we move from a linear algebra analysis to a statistical analysis. In particular, we will focus on what the regularization terms can result in.
We will amongst other things show that the regularization parameter can reduce considerably the variance of the parameters $\beta$.


!split
===== Yet another Example =====

Let us assume we have a data set with outputs/targets given by the vector

!bt
\[
\bm{y}=\begin{bmatrix}4 \\ 2 \\3\end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
and our inputs as a $3\times 2$ design matrix
!bt
\[
\bm{X}=\begin{bmatrix}2 & 0\\ 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0\end{bmatrix},
\]
!et
meaning that we have two features and two unknown parameters $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ to be determined either by ordinary least squares, Ridge or Lasso regression.

!split
===== The OLS case =====

For ordinary least squares (OLS) we know that the optimal solution is

!bt
\[
\hat{\bm{\beta}}^{\mathrm{OLS}}=\left( \bm{X}^T\bm{X}\right)^{-1}\bm{X}^T\bm{y}.
\]
!et
Inserting the above values we obtain that 

!bt
\[
\hat{\bm{\beta}}^{\mathrm{OLS}}=\begin{bmatrix}2 \\ 2\end{bmatrix},
\]
!et

The code which implements this simpler case is presented after the discussion of Ridge and Lasso.

!split
===== The Ridge case =====

For Ridge regression we have

!bt
\[
\hat{\bm{\beta}}^{\mathrm{Ridge}}=\left( \bm{X}^T\bm{X}+\lambda\bm{I}\right)^{-1}\bm{X}^T\bm{y}.
\]
!et
Inserting the above values we obtain that 

!bt
\[
\hat{\bm{\beta}}^{\mathrm{Ridge}}=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{8}{4+\lambda} \\ \frac{2}{1+\lambda}\end{bmatrix},
\]
!et

There is normally a constraint on the value of $\vert\vert \bm{\beta}\vert\vert_2$ via the parameter $\lambda$.
Let us for simplicity assume that $\beta_0^2+\beta_1^2=1$ as constraint. This will allow us to find an expression for the optimal values of $\beta$ and $\lambda$.

To see this, let us write the cost function for Ridge regression.  


!split
===== Writing the Cost Function =====

We define the MSE without the $1/n$ factor and have then, using that
!bt
\[
\bm{X}\bm{\beta}=\begin{bmatrix} 2\beta_0 \\ \beta_1 \\0 \end{bmatrix},
\]
!et

!bt
\[
C(\bm{\beta})=(4-2\beta_0)^2+(2-\beta_1)^2+\lambda(\beta_0^2+\beta_1^2),
\]
!et
and taking the derivative with respect to $\beta_0$ we get
!bt
\[
\beta_0=\frac{8}{4+\lambda},
\]
!et
and for $\beta_1$ we obtain
!bt
\[
\beta_1=\frac{2}{1+\lambda},
\]
!et

Using the constraint for $\beta_0^2+\beta_1^2=1$ we can constrain $\lambda$ by solving
!bt
\[
\left(\frac{8}{4+\lambda}\right)^2+\left(\frac{2}{1+\lambda}\right)^2=1,
\]
!et
which gives $\lambda=4.571$ and $\beta_0=0.933$ and $\beta_1=0.359$.

!split
===== Lasso case =====

For Lasso we need now, keeping a  constraint on $\vert\beta_0\vert+\vert\beta_1\vert=1$,  to take the derivative of the absolute values of $\beta_0$
and $\beta_1$. This gives us the following derivatives of the cost function
!bt
\[
C(\bm{\beta})=(4-2\beta_0)^2+(2-\beta_1)^2+\lambda(\vert\beta_0\vert+\vert\beta_1\vert),
\]
!et

!bt
\[
\frac{\partial C(\bm{\beta})}{\partial \beta_0}=-4(4-2\beta_0)+\lambda\mathrm{sgn}(\beta_0)=0,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\frac{\partial C(\bm{\beta})}{\partial \beta_1}=-2(2-\beta_1)+\lambda\mathrm{sgn}(\beta_1)=0.
\]
!et
We have now four cases to solve besides the trivial cases $\beta_0$ and/or $\beta_1$ are zero, namely
o $\beta_0 > 0$ and $\beta_1 > 0$,
o $\beta_0 > 0$ and $\beta_1 < 0$,
o $\beta_0 < 0$ and $\beta_1 > 0$,
o $\beta_0 < 0$ and $\beta_1 < 0$.

!split
===== The first Case =====

If we consider the first case, we have then
!bt
\[
-4(4-2\beta_0)+\lambda=0,
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
-2(2-\beta_1)+\lambda=0.
\]
!et
which yields

!bt
\[
\beta_0=\frac{16+\lambda}{8},
\]
!et
and
!bt
\[
\beta_1=\frac{4+\lambda}{2}.
\]
!et

Using the constraint on $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ we can then find the optimal value of $\lambda$ for the different cases. We leave this as an exercise to you.

!split
===== Simple code for solving the above problem =====

Here we set up the OLS, Ridge and Lasso functionality in order to study the above example. Note that here we have opted for a set of values of $\lambda$, meaning that we need to perform a search in order to find the optimal values.

First we study and compare the OLS and Ridge results.  The next code compares all three methods.


!bc pycod
import os
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def R2(y_data, y_model):
    return 1 - np.sum((y_data - y_model) ** 2) / np.sum((y_data - np.mean(y_data)) ** 2)
def MSE(y_data,y_model):
    n = np.size(y_model)
    return np.sum((y_data-y_model)**2)/n


# A seed just to ensure that the random numbers are the same for every run.
# Useful for eventual debugging.

X = np.array( [ [ 2, 0], [0, 1], [0,0]])
y = np.array( [4, 2, 3])


# matrix inversion to find beta
OLSbeta = np.linalg.inv(X.T @ X) @ X.T @ y
print(OLSbeta)
# and then make the prediction
ytildeOLS = X @ OLSbeta
print("Training MSE for OLS")
print(MSE(y,ytildeOLS))
ypredictOLS = X @ OLSbeta

# Repeat now for Ridge regression and various values of the regularization parameter
I = np.eye(2,2)

===== Linking the regression analysis with a statistical interpretation =====


The
advantage of doing linear regression is that we actually end up with
analytical expressions for several statistical quantities.  
Standard least squares and Ridge regression  allow us to
derive quantities like the variance and other expectation values in a
rather straightforward way.


It is assumed that $\varepsilon_i
\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ and the $\varepsilon_{i}$ are
independent, i.e.: 
!bt
\begin{align*} 
\mbox{Cov}(\varepsilon_{i_1},
\varepsilon_{i_2}) & = \left\{ \begin{array}{lcc} \sigma^2 & \mbox{if}
& i_1 = i_2, \\ 0 & \mbox{if} & i_1 \not= i_2.  \end{array} \right.
\end{align*} 
!et
The randomness of $\varepsilon_i$ implies that
$\mathbf{y}_i$ is also a random variable. In particular,
$\mathbf{y}_i$ is normally distributed, because $\varepsilon_i \sim
\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$ and $\mathbf{X}_{i,\ast} \, \bm{\beta}$ is a
non-random scalar. To specify the parameters of the distribution of
$\mathbf{y}_i$ we need to calculate its first two moments. 

Recall that $\bm{X}$ is a matrix of dimensionality $n\times p$. The
notation above $\mathbf{X}_{i,\ast}$ means that we are looking at the
row number $i$ and perform a sum over all values $p$.


!split
===== Assumptions made =====

The assumption we have made here can be summarized as (and this is going to be useful when we discuss the bias-variance trade off)
that there exists a function $f(\bm{x})$ and  a normal distributed error $\bm{\varepsilon}\sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$
which describe our data
!bt
\[
\bm{y} = f(\bm{x})+\bm{\varepsilon}
\]
!et

We approximate this function with our model from the solution of the linear regression equations, that is our
function $f$ is approximated by $\bm{\tilde{y}}$ where we want to minimize $(\bm{y}-\bm{\tilde{y}})^2$, our MSE, with
!bt
\[
\bm{\tilde{y}} = \bm{X}\bm{\beta}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Expectation value and variance =====

We can calculate the expectation value of $\bm{y}$ for a given element $i$ 
!bt
\begin{align*} 
\mathbb{E}(y_i) & =
\mathbb{E}(\mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \bm{\beta}) + \mathbb{E}(\varepsilon_i)
\, \, \, = \, \, \, \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \beta, 
\end{align*} 
!et
while
its variance is 
!bt
\begin{align*} \mbox{Var}(y_i) & = \mathbb{E} \{ [y_i
- \mathbb{E}(y_i)]^2 \} \, \, \, = \, \, \, \mathbb{E} ( y_i^2 ) -
[\mathbb{E}(y_i)]^2  \\  & = \mathbb{E} [ ( \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \,
\beta + \varepsilon_i )^2] - ( \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \bm{\beta})^2 \\ &
= \mathbb{E} [ ( \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \bm{\beta})^2 + 2 \varepsilon_i
\mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \bm{\beta} + \varepsilon_i^2 ] - ( \mathbf{X}_{i,
\ast} \, \beta)^2 \\  & = ( \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \bm{\beta})^2 + 2
\mathbb{E}(\varepsilon_i) \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \bm{\beta} +
\mathbb{E}(\varepsilon_i^2 ) - ( \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \bm{\beta})^2 
\\ & = \mathbb{E}(\varepsilon_i^2 ) \, \, \, = \, \, \,
\mbox{Var}(\varepsilon_i) \, \, \, = \, \, \, \sigma^2.  
\end{align*}
!et
Hence, $y_i \sim \mathcal{N}( \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast} \, \bm{\beta}, \sigma^2)$, that is $\bm{y}$ follows a normal distribution with 
mean value $\bm{X}\bm{\beta}$ and variance $\sigma^2$ (not be confused with the singular values of the SVD). 

!split
===== Expectation value and variance for $\bm{\beta}$ =====

With the OLS expressions for the parameters $\bm{\beta}$ we can evaluate the expectation value
!bt
\[
\mathbb{E}(\bm{\beta}) = \mathbb{E}[ (\mathbf{X}^{\top} \mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{Y}]=(\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbb{E}[ \mathbf{Y}]=(\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1} \mathbf{X}^{T}\mathbf{X}\bm{\beta}=\bm{\beta}.
\]
!et
This means that the estimator of the regression parameters is unbiased.

We can also calculate the variance

The variance of $\bm{\beta}$ is
!bt
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mbox{Var}(\bm{\beta}) & = & \mathbb{E} \{ [\bm{\beta} - \mathbb{E}(\bm{\beta})] [\bm{\beta} - \mathbb{E}(\bm{\beta})]^{T} \}
\\
& = & \mathbb{E} \{ [(\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1} \, \mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{Y} - \bm{\beta}] \, [(\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1} \, \mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{Y} - \bm{\beta}]^{T} \}
\\
% & = & \mathbb{E} \{ [(\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1} \, \mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{Y}] \, [(\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1} \, \mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{Y}]^{T} \} - \bm{\beta} \, \bm{\beta}^{T}
% \\
% & = & \mathbb{E} \{ (\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1} \, \mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{Y} \, \mathbf{Y}^{T} \, \mathbf{X} \, (\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1}  \} - \bm{\beta} \, \bm{\beta}^{T}
% \\
& = & (\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1} \, \mathbf{X}^{T} \, \mathbb{E} \{ \mathbf{Y} \, \mathbf{Y}^{T} \} \, \mathbf{X} \, (\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1} - \bm{\beta} \, \bm{\beta}^{T}
\\
& = & (\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1} \, \mathbf{X}^{T} \, \{ \mathbf{X} \, \bm{\beta} \, \bm{\beta}^{T} \,  \mathbf{X}^{T} + \sigma^2 \} \, \mathbf{X} \, (\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1} - \bm{\beta} \, \bm{\beta}^{T}
% \\
% & = & (\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1} \, \mathbf{X}^T \, \mathbf{X} \, \bm{\beta} \, \bm{\beta}^T \,  \mathbf{X}^T \, \mathbf{X} \, (\mathbf{X}^T % \mathbf{X})^{-1}
% \\
% & & + \, \, \sigma^2 \, (\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1} \, \mathbf{X}^T  \, \mathbf{X} \, (\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1} - \bm{\beta} \bm{\beta}^T
\\
& = & \bm{\beta} \, \bm{\beta}^{T}  + \sigma^2 \, (\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1} - \bm{\beta} \, \bm{\beta}^{T}
\, \, \, = \, \, \, \sigma^2 \, (\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1},
\end{eqnarray*}
!et

where we have used  that $\mathbb{E} (\mathbf{Y} \mathbf{Y}^{T}) =
\mathbf{X} \, \bm{\beta} \, \bm{\beta}^{T} \, \mathbf{X}^{T} +
\sigma^2 \, \mathbf{I}_{nn}$. From $\mbox{Var}(\bm{\beta}) = \sigma^2
\, (\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1}$, one obtains an estimate of the
variance of the estimate of the $j$-th regression coefficient:
$\bm{\sigma}^2 (\bm{\beta}_j ) = \bm{\sigma}^2 \sqrt{
[(\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1}]_{jj} }$. This may be used to
construct a confidence interval for the estimates.


In a similar way, we can obtain analytical expressions for say the
expectation values of the parameters $\bm{\beta}$ and their variance
when we employ Ridge regression, allowing us again to define a confidence interval. 

It is rather straightforward to show that
!bt
\[
\mathbb{E} \big[ \bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{Ridge}} \big]=(\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X} + \lambda \mathbf{I}_{pp})^{-1} (\mathbf{X}^{\top} \mathbf{X})\bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{OLS}}.
\]
!et
We see clearly that 
$\mathbb{E} \big[ \bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{Ridge}} \big] \not= \bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{OLS}}$ for any $\lambda > 0$. We say then that the ridge estimator is biased.

We can also compute the variance as 

!bt
\[
\mbox{Var}[\bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{Ridge}}]=\sigma^2[  \mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X} + \lambda \mathbf{I} ]^{-1}  \mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X} \{ [  \mathbf{X}^{\top} \mathbf{X} + \lambda \mathbf{I} ]^{-1}\}^{T},
\]
!et
and it is easy to see that if the parameter $\lambda$ goes to infinity then the variance of Ridge parameters $\bm{\beta}$ goes to zero. 

With this, we can compute the difference 

!bt
\[
\mbox{Var}[\bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{OLS}}]-\mbox{Var}(\bm{\beta}^{\mathrm{Ridge}})=\sigma^2 [  \mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X} + \lambda \mathbf{I} ]^{-1}[ 2\lambda\mathbf{I} + \lambda^2 (\mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X})^{-1} ] \{ [  \mathbf{X}^{T} \mathbf{X} + \lambda \mathbf{I} ]^{-1}\}^{T}.
\]
!et
The difference is non-negative definite since each component of the
matrix product is non-negative definite. 
This means the variance we obtain with the standard OLS will always for $\lambda > 0$ be larger than the variance of $\bm{\beta}$ obtained with the Ridge estimator. This has interesting consequences when we discuss the so-called bias-variance trade-off below. 


!split
===== Deriving OLS from a probability distribution =====

Our basic assumption when we derived the OLS equations was to assume
that our output is determined by a given continuous function
$f(\bm{x})$ and a random noise $\bm{\epsilon}$ given by the normal
distribution with zero mean value and an undetermined variance
$\sigma^2$.

We found above that the outputs $\bm{y}$ have a mean value given by
$\bm{X}\hat{\bm{\beta}}$ and variance $\sigma^2$. Since the entries to
the design matrix are not stochastic variables, we can assume that the
probability distribution of our targets is also a normal distribution
but now with mean value $\bm{X}\hat{\bm{\beta}}$. This means that a
single output $y_i$ is given by the Gaussian distribution

!bt
\[
y_i\sim \mathcal{N}(\bm{X}_{i,*}\bm{\beta}, \sigma^2)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\exp{\left[-\frac{(y_i-\bm{X}_{i,*}\bm{\beta})^2}{2\sigma^2}\right]}.
\]
!et

!split
===== Independent and Identically Distrubuted (iid) =====

We assume now that the various $y_i$ values are stochastically distributed according to the above Gaussian distribution. 
We define this distribution as
!bt
\[
p(y_i\vert \bm{X};\bm{\beta})=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\exp{\left[-\frac{(y_i-\bm{X}_{i,*}\bm{\beta})^2}{2\sigma^2}\right]},
\]
!et
which reads as finding the likelihood of an event $y_i$ given the input variables $\bm{X}$ and the parameters (to be determined) $\bm{\beta}$.

Since these events are assumed to be independent and identicall distributed we can build the probability distribution function (PDF) for all possible event $\bm{y}$ as the product of the single events, that is we have

!bt
\[
p(\bm{y}\vert \bm{X};\bm{\beta})=\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\exp{\left[-\frac{(y_i-\bm{X}_{i,*}\bm{\beta})^2}{2\sigma^2}\right]}=\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}p(y_i\vert \bm{X};\bm{\beta}).
\]
!et

!split
===== Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) =====

In statistics, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is a method of
estimating the parameters of an assumed probability distribution,
given some observed data. This is achieved by maximizing a likelihood
function so that, under the assumed statistical model, the observed
data is the most probable. 


We will assume here that our events are given by the above Gaussian
distribution and we will determine the optimal parameters $\beta$ by
maximizing the above PDF. However, computing the derivatives of a
product function is cumbersome and can easily lead to overflow and/or
underflowproblems, with potentials for loss of numerical precision.


In practice, it is more convenient to maximize the logarithm of the
PDF because it is a monotonically increasing function of the argument.
Alternatively, and this will be our option, we will minimize the
negative of the logarithm since this is a monotonically decreasing
function.

Note also that maximization/minimization of the logarithm of the PDF
is equivalent to the maximization/minimization of the function itself.



!split
===== A new Cost Function =====

We could now define a new cost function to minimize, namely the negative logarithm of the above PDF

!bt
\[
C(\bm{\beta}=-\log{\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}p(y_i\vert \bm{X};\bm{\beta})}=-\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\log{p(y_i\vert \bm{X};\bm{\beta})},
\]
!et
which becomes
!bt
\[
C(\bm{\beta}=\frac{n}{2}\log{2\pi\sigma^2}+\frac{\vert\vert (\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta})\vert\vert_2^2}{2\sigma^2}.
\]
!et

Taking the derivative of the *new* cost function with respect to the parameters $\beta$ we recognize our familiar OLS equation, namely

!bt
\[
\bm{X}^T\left(\bm{y}-\bm{X}\bm{\beta}\right) =0,
\]
!et
which leads to the well-known OLS equation for the optimal paramters $\beta$
!bt
\[
\hat{\bm{\beta}}^{\mathrm{OLS}}=\left(\bm{X}^T\bm{X}\right)^{-1}\bm{X}^T\bm{y}!
\]
!et


Before we make a similar analysis for Ridge and Lasso regression, we need a new reminder on statistics. 

!split
===== More basic Statistics and Bayes' theorem =====

A central theorem in statistics is Bayes' theorem. This theorem plays a similar role as the good old Pythagoras' theorem in geometry.
Bayes' theorem is extremely simple to derive. But to do so we need some basic axioms from statistics.

Assume we have two domains of events $X=[x_0,x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}]$ and $Y=[y_0,y_1,\dots,y_{n-1}]$.

We define also the likelihood for $X$ and $Y$ as $p(X)$ and $p(Y)$ respectively.
The likelihood of a specific event $x_i$ (or $y_i$) is then written as $p(X=x_i)$ or just $p(x_i)=p_i$. 

!bblock Union of events is given by
!bt
\[
p(X \cup Y)= p(X)+p(Y)-p(X \cap Y).
\]
!et
!eblock


!bblock The product rule (aka joint probability) is given by
!bt
\[
p(X \cup Y)= p(X,Y)= p(X\vert Y)p(Y)=p(Y\vert X)p(x),
\]
!et
where we read $p(X\vert Y)$ as the likelihood of obtaining $X$ given $Y$.
!eblock

If we have independent events then $p(X,Y)=p(X)p(Y)$.


!split
===== Marginal Probability =====

The marginal probability is defined in terms of only of the set of variables $X,Y$. For a discrete probability we have
!bblock Discrete Probability
!bt
\[
p(X)=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}p(X,Y=y_i)=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}p(X\vert Y=y_i)p(Y=y_i)=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}p(X\vert y_i)p(y_i).
\]

!eblock

The conditional  probability, if $p(Y) > 0$, is 
!bblock

\[

\]
!et
!eblock


!split
===== Bayes' Theorem =====

If we combine the conditional probability with the marginal probability and the standard product rule, we have
!bt
\[
p(X\vert Y)= \frac{p(X,Y)}{p(Y)},
\]
!et
which we can rewrite as

!bt
\[
p(X\vert Y)= \frac{p(X,Y)}{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}p(Y\vert X=x_i)p(x_i)}=\frac{p(Y\vert X)p(X)}{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}p(Y\vert X=x_i)p(x_i)},
\]

===== Why resampling methods =====

Before we proceed, we need to rethink what we have been doing. In our
eager to fit the data, we have omitted several important elements in
our regression analysis. In what follows we will
o look at statistical properties, including a discussion of mean values, variance and the so-called bias-variance tradeoff
o introduce resampling techniques like cross-validation, bootstrapping and jackknife and more

This will allow us to link the standard linear algebra methods we have discussed above to a statistical interpretation of the methods. 





!split
===== Resampling methods =====
!bblock
Resampling methods are an indispensable tool in modern
statistics. They involve repeatedly drawing samples from a training
set and refitting a model of interest on each sample in order to
obtain additional information about the fitted model. For example, in
order to estimate the variability of a linear regression fit, we can
repeatedly draw different samples from the training data, fit a linear
regression to each new sample, and then examine the extent to which
the resulting fits differ. Such an approach may allow us to obtain
information that would not be available from fitting the model only
once using the original training sample.

Two resampling methods are often used in Machine Learning analyses,
o The _bootstrap method_
o and _Cross-Validation_

In addition there are several other methods such as the Jackknife and the Blocking methods. We will discuss in particular
cross-validation and the bootstrap method. 


!eblock


!split
===== Resampling approaches can be computationally expensive =====
!bblock

Resampling approaches can be computationally expensive, because they
involve fitting the same statistical method multiple times using
different subsets of the training data. However, due to recent
advances in computing power, the computational requirements of
resampling methods generally are not prohibitive. In this chapter, we
discuss two of the most commonly used resampling methods,
cross-validation and the bootstrap. Both methods are important tools
in the practical application of many statistical learning
procedures. For example, cross-validation can be used to estimate the
test error associated with a given statistical learning method in
order to evaluate its performance, or to select the appropriate level
of flexibility. The process of evaluating a model’s performance is
known as model assessment, whereas the process of selecting the proper
level of flexibility for a model is known as model selection. The
bootstrap is widely used.

!split
===== Resampling methods =====

With all these analytical equations for both the OLS and Ridge
regression, we will now outline how to assess a given model. This will
lead us to a discussion of the so-called bias-variance tradeoff (see
below) and so-called resampling methods.

One of the quantities we have discussed as a way to measure errors is
the mean-squared error (MSE), mainly used for fitting of continuous
functions. Another choice is the absolute error.

In the discussions below we will focus on the MSE and in particular since we will split the data into test and training data,
we discuss the
o prediction error or simply the _test error_ $\mathrm{Err_{Test}}$, where we have a fixed training set and the test error is the MSE arising from the data reserved for testing. We discuss also the 
o training error $\mathrm{Err_{Train}}$, which is the average loss over the training data.

As our model becomes more and more complex, more of the training data tends to  used. The training may thence adapt to more complicated structures in the data. This may lead to a decrease in the bias (see below for code example) and a slight increase of the variance for the test error.
For a certain level of complexity the test error will reach minimum, before starting to increase again. The
training error reaches a saturation.




!split
===== Resampling methods: Jackknife and Bootstrap =====

Two famous
resampling methods are the _independent bootstrap_ and _the jackknife_. 

The jackknife is a special case of the independent bootstrap. Still, the jackknife was made
popular prior to the independent bootstrap. And as the popularity of
the independent bootstrap soared, new variants, such as _the dependent bootstrap_.

The Jackknife and independent bootstrap work for
independent, identically distributed random variables.
If these conditions are not
satisfied, the methods will fail.  Yet, it should be said that if the data are
independent, identically distributed, and we only want to estimate the
variance of $\overline{X}$ (which often is the case), then there is no
need for bootstrapping.

===== Resampling methods: Jackknife =====

The Jackknife works by making many replicas of the estimator $\widehat{\theta}$. 
The jackknife is a resampling method where we systematically leave out one observation from the vector of observed values $\bm{x} = (x_1,x_2,\cdots,X_n)$. 
Let $\bm{x}_i$ denote the vector
!bt
\[
\bm{x}_i = (x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_{i-1},x_{i+1},\cdots,x_n),
\]
!et

which equals the vector $\bm{x}$ with the exception that observation
number $i$ is left out. Using this notation, define
$\widehat{\theta}_i$ to be the estimator
$\widehat{\theta}$ computed using $\vec{X}_i$.

===== Resampling methods: Bootstrap =====
!bblock
Bootstrapping is a nonparametric approach to statistical inference
that substitutes computation for more traditional distributional
assumptions and asymptotic results. Bootstrapping offers a number of
advantages: 
o The bootstrap is quite general, although there are some cases in which it fails.  
o Because it does not require distributional assumptions (such as normally distributed errors), the bootstrap can provide more accurate inferences when the data are not well behaved or when the sample size is small.  
o It is possible to apply the bootstrap to statistics with sampling distributions that are difficult to derive, even asymptotically. 
o It is relatively simple to apply the bootstrap to complex data-collection plans (such as stratified and clustered samples).
!eblock


!split
===== Resampling methods: Bootstrap background =====

Since $\widehat{\theta} = \widehat{\theta}(\bm{X})$ is a function of random variables,
$\widehat{\theta}$ itself must be a random variable. Thus it has
a pdf, call this function $p(\bm{t})$. The aim of the bootstrap is to
estimate $p(\bm{t})$ by the relative frequency of
$\widehat{\theta}$. You can think of this as using a histogram
in the place of $p(\bm{t})$. If the relative frequency closely
resembles $p(\vec{t})$, then using numerics, it is straight forward to
estimate all the interesting parameters of $p(\bm{t})$ using point
estimators.  


!split
===== Resampling methods: More Bootstrap background =====

In the case that $\widehat{\theta}$ has
more than one component, and the components are independent, we use the
same estimator on each component separately.  If the probability
density function of $X_i$, $p(x)$, had been known, then it would have
been straight forward to do this by: 
o Drawing lots of numbers from $p(x)$, suppose we call one such set of numbers $(X_1^*, X_2^*, \cdots, X_n^*)$. 
o Then using these numbers, we could compute a replica of $\widehat{\theta}$ called $\widehat{\theta}^*$. 

By repeated use of (1) and (2), many
estimates of $\widehat{\theta}$ could have been obtained. The
idea is to use the relative frequency of $\widehat{\theta}^*$
(think of a histogram) as an estimate of $p(\bm{t})$.

!split
===== Resampling methods: Bootstrap approach =====

But
unless there is enough information available about the process that
generated $X_1,X_2,\cdots,X_n$, $p(x)$ is in general
unknown. Therefore, "Efron in 1979":"https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1176344552"  asked the
question: What if we replace $p(x)$ by the relative frequency
of the observation $X_i$; if we draw observations in accordance with
the relative frequency of the observations, will we obtain the same
result in some asymptotic sense? The answer is yes.


Instead of generating the histogram for the relative
frequency of the observation $X_i$, just draw the values
$(X_1^*,X_2^*,\cdots,X_n^*)$ with replacement from the vector
$\bm{X}$. 

!split
===== Resampling methods: Bootstrap steps =====

The independent bootstrap works like this: 

o Draw with replacement $n$ numbers for the observed variables $\bm{x} = (x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n)$. 
o Define a vector $\bm{x}^*$ containing the values which were drawn from $\bm{x}$. 
o Using the vector $\bm{x}^*$ compute $\widehat{\theta}^*$ by evaluating $\widehat \theta$ under the observations $\bm{x}^*$. 
o Repeat this process $k$ times. 

When you are done, you can draw a histogram of the relative frequency
of $\widehat \theta^*$. This is your estimate of the probability
distribution $p(t)$. Using this probability distribution you can
estimate any statistics thereof. In principle you never draw the
histogram of the relative frequency of $\widehat{\theta}^*$. Instead
you use the estimators corresponding to the statistic of interest. For
example, if you are interested in estimating the variance of $\widehat
\theta$, apply the etsimator $\widehat \sigma^2$ to the values
$\widehat \theta ^*$.


!split
===== Code example for the Bootstrap method =====

The following code starts with a Gaussian distribution with mean value
$\mu =100$ and variance $\sigma=15$. We use this to generate the data
used in the bootstrap analysis. The bootstrap analysis returns a data
set after a given number of bootstrap operations (as many as we have
data points). This data set consists of estimated mean values for each
bootstrap operation. The histogram generated by the bootstrap method
shows that the distribution for these mean values is also a Gaussian,
centered around the mean value $\mu=100$ but with standard deviation
$\sigma/\sqrt{n}$, where $n$ is the number of bootstrap samples (in
this case the same as the number of original data points). The value
of the standard deviation is what we expect from the central limit
theorem.

===== Various steps in cross-validation =====

When the repetitive splitting of the data set is done randomly,
samples may accidently end up in a fast majority of the splits in
either training or test set. Such samples may have an unbalanced
influence on either model building or prediction evaluation. To avoid
this $k$-fold cross-validation structures the data splitting. The
samples are divided into $k$ more or less equally sized exhaustive and
mutually exclusive subsets. In turn (at each split) one of these
subsets plays the role of the test set while the union of the
remaining subsets constitutes the training set. Such a splitting
warrants a balanced representation of each sample in both training and
test set over the splits. Still the division into the $k$ subsets
involves a degree of randomness. This may be fully excluded when
choosing $k=n$. This particular case is referred to as leave-one-out
cross-validation (LOOCV). 

!split 
===== How to set up the cross-validation for Ridge and/or Lasso =====

* Define a range of interest for the penalty parameter.

* Divide the data set into training and test set comprising samples $\{1, \ldots, n\} \setminus i$ and $\{ i \}$, respectively.

* Fit the linear regression model by means of ridge estimation  for each $\lambda$ in the grid using the training set, and the corresponding estimate of the error variance $\bm{\sigma}_{-i}^2(\lambda)$, as
!bt
\begin{align*}
\bm{\beta}_{-i}(\lambda) & =  ( \bm{X}_{-i, \ast}^{T}
\bm{X}_{-i, \ast} + \lambda \bm{I}_{pp})^{-1}
\bm{X}_{-i, \ast}^{T} \bm{y}_{-i}
\end{align*}
!et 

* Evaluate the prediction performance of these models on the test set by $\log\{L[y_i, \bm{X}_{i, \ast}; \bm{\beta}_{-i}(\lambda), \bm{\sigma}_{-i}^2(\lambda)]\}$. Or, by the prediction error $|y_i - \bm{X}_{i, \ast} \bm{\beta}_{-i}(\lambda)|$, the relative error, the error squared or the R2 score function.

* Repeat the first three steps  such that each sample plays the role of the test set once.

* Average the prediction performances of the test sets at each grid point of the penalty bias/parameter. It is an estimate of the prediction performance of the model corresponding to this value of the penalty parameter on novel data. It is defined as
!bt
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n \log\{L[y_i, \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast}; \bm{\beta}_{-i}(\lambda), \bm{\sigma}_{-i}^2(\lambda)]\}.
\end{align*}
!et

!split
===== Cross-validation in brief =====

For the various values of $k$

o shuffle the dataset randomly.
o Split the dataset into $k$ groups.
o For each unique group:
 o Decide which group to use as set for test data
 o Take the remaining groups as a training data set
 o Fit a model on the training set and evaluate it on the test set
 o Retain the evaluation score and discard the model
o Summarize the model using the sample of model evaluation scores

===== The bias-variance tradeoff =====


We will discuss the bias-variance tradeoff in the context of
continuous predictions such as regression. However, many of the
intuitions and ideas discussed here also carry over to classification
tasks. Consider a dataset $\mathcal{L}$ consisting of the data
$\mathbf{X}_\mathcal{L}=\{(y_j, \boldsymbol{x}_j), j=0\ldots n-1\}$. 

Let us assume that the true data is generated from a noisy model

!bt
\[
\bm{y}=f(\boldsymbol{x}) + \bm{\epsilon}
\]
!et

where $\epsilon$ is normally distributed with mean zero and standard deviation $\sigma^2$.

In our derivation of the ordinary least squares method we defined then
an approximation to the function $f$ in terms of the parameters
$\bm{\beta}$ and the design matrix $\bm{X}$ which embody our model,
that is $\bm{\tilde{y}}=\bm{X}\bm{\beta}$. 

Thereafter we found the parameters $\bm{\beta}$ by optimizing the means squared error via the so-called cost function
!bt
\[
C(\bm{X},\bm{\beta}) =\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(y_i-\tilde{y}_i)^2=\mathbb{E}\left[(\bm{y}-\bm{\tilde{y}})^2\right].
\]
!et

We can rewrite this as 
!bt
\[
\mathbb{E}\left[(\bm{y}-\bm{\tilde{y}})^2\right]=\frac{1}{n}\sum_i(f_i-\mathbb{E}\left[\bm{\tilde{y}}\right])^2+\frac{1}{n}\sum_i(\tilde{y}_i-\mathbb{E}\left[\bm{\tilde{y}}\right])^2+\sigma^2.
\]
!et

The three terms represent the square of the bias of the learning
method, which can be thought of as the error caused by the simplifying
assumptions built into the method. The second term represents the
variance of the chosen model and finally the last terms is variance of
the error $\bm{\epsilon}$.

To derive this equation, we need to recall that the variance of $\bm{y}$ and $\bm{\epsilon}$ are both equal to $\sigma^2$. The mean value of $\bm{\epsilon}$ is by definition equal to zero. Furthermore, the function $f$ is not a stochastics variable, idem for $\bm{\tilde{y}}$.
We use a more compact notation in terms of the expectation value 
!bt
\[
\mathbb{E}\left[(\bm{y}-\bm{\tilde{y}})^2\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[(\bm{f}+\bm{\epsilon}-\bm{\tilde{y}})^2\right],
\]
!et
and adding and subtracting $\mathbb{E}\left[\bm{\tilde{y}}\right]$ we get
!bt
\[
\mathbb{E}\left[(\bm{y}-\bm{\tilde{y}})^2\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[(\bm{f}+\bm{\epsilon}-\bm{\tilde{y}}+\mathbb{E}\left[\bm{\tilde{y}}\right]-\mathbb{E}\left[\bm{\tilde{y}}\right])^2\right],
\]
!et
which, using the abovementioned expectation values can be rewritten as 
!bt
\[
\mathbb{E}\left[(\bm{y}-\bm{\tilde{y}})^2\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[(\bm{y}-\mathbb{E}\left[\bm{\tilde{y}}\right])^2\right]+\mathrm{Var}\left[\bm{\tilde{y}}\right]+\sigma^2,
\]
!et
that is the rewriting in terms of the so-called bias, the variance of the model $\bm{\tilde{y}}$ and the variance of $\bm{\epsilon}$.

===== Summing up ===== 




The bias-variance tradeoff summarizes the fundamental tension in
machine learning, particularly supervised learning, between the
complexity of a model and the amount of training data needed to train
it.  Since data is often limited, in practice it is often useful to
use a less-complex model with higher bias, that is  a model whose asymptotic
performance is worse than another model because it is easier to
train and less sensitive to sampling noise arising from having a
finite-sized training dataset (smaller variance). 



The above equations tell us that in
order to minimize the expected test error, we need to select a
statistical learning method that simultaneously achieves low variance
and low bias. Note that variance is inherently a nonnegative quantity,
and squared bias is also nonnegative. Hence, we see that the expected
test MSE can never lie below $Var(\epsilon)$, the irreducible error.


What do we mean by the variance and bias of a statistical learning
method? The variance refers to the amount by which our model would change if we
estimated it using a different training data set. Since the training
data are used to fit the statistical learning method, different
training data sets  will result in a different estimate. But ideally the
estimate for our model should not vary too much between training
sets. However, if a method has high variance  then small changes in
the training data can result in large changes in the model. In general, more
flexible statistical methods have higher variance.

============================
Underfitting vs. Overfitting
============================

This example demonstrates the problems of underfitting and overfitting and
how we can use linear regression with polynomial features to approximate
nonlinear functions. The plot shows the function that we want to approximate,
which is a part of the cosine function. In addition, the samples from the
real function and the approximations of different models are displayed. The
models have polynomial features of different degrees. We can see that a
linear function (polynomial with degree 1) is not sufficient to fit the
training samples. This is called **underfitting**. A polynomial of degree 4
approximates the true function almost perfectly. However, for higher degrees
the model will **overfit** the training data, i.e. it learns the noise of the
training data.
We evaluate quantitatively **overfitting** / **underfitting** by using
cross-validation. We calculate the mean squared error (MSE) on the validation
set, the higher, the less likely the model generalizes correctly from the
training data.
